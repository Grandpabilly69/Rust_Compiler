Introduction

A compiler is just a Language Translator

4 phases:

Pre-processor:
removes comments
removes the imports 
this makes only the actual code needed stored

Compiler:
converts High level language code into assembly 

Assembler:
generates relocatable machine code
relocatable means that it doesn't need to be stored in a specific space in ram

Linker/Loader:
generates the absolute machine code


compiler has 6 different phases:

first 3 phases are the analysis phase
the last 3 are considered Synthesis phase

first 4 phases are front end
last 2 are back end

There are 2 other components with this
Symbol Table Manager
Error Handler


1.Lexical Analysis:


2.Syntax Analysis:


3.Semantic Analysis:


4.Intermediate Code Generation:


5.Code Optimization:


6.Target Code Generation:
