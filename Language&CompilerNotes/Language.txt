Language:

operators will be the same 
	eg. +-*= so on

if statements:
	if(condition){
		operations
	}

variables:
	var name = whatever

loops:
	for(condition){
		operations
	}
	\\note that loops will be the same. there will only be for loops but they can do different stuff

functions:
	func name (parameter names) => var{
		operations
		return variable name
	}
