This compiler is for fun. I have created the Lexer to generate the tokens, the parse tree, and the semantic analysis to see if there arre any syntax errors. I now have recently added the Intermediate code generator to convert the stuff into lower level syntax to prepare for converting it into assembly. I have now added the code optimizer for the intermediate code generater. I have to also implement pemdas rules for math. A true function thingys that basically prioritizes certain functions and implement my loops and conditions.
